This file outlines what each of the image files here do.

m1-frehd-boot.dmk - Model I Boot Disk 
m3-4p-frehd-boot.dmk - Model III and 4P Boot Disk - Contains FreHD-compatible MODELA/III file for the 4P.
m4-frehd-boot.dmk - Model 4/4GA/4D Boot Disk
alt_4p directory - Contains the original Model 4P boot disk and a companion frehd.rom (patched bt Matt Boytim) for faster booting on the 4P.

The Models I, III and 4P disks have been boot-tested in trs80gp, but I do not have these machines and therefore have not tested on real systems with a FreHD.  Note that I have written the routine to track zero, both secotrs zero and one, on all images per a request to do so.
